# Task List

Let's build a Task List in Rails! We will solve the problem of tracking tasks in a web application. This project will enable us to keep track of and persist, add, edit and remove tasks. 

## At a Glance
- Individual, [stage 1](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/pedagogy/blob/master/classroom/rule-of-three.md#stage-1) project
- Due before class on **Tuesday May 5th**

## Learning Goals

Practice all aspects of Rails development.

- Create a new Rails application
- Explore each aspect of the Rails Request Cycle: Model, View, Controller
- Implement RESTful routes using Rails standards
- Complete all CRUD actions in a Rails application

## Baseline

In this baseline, you'll create a new Rails application and get started with two of the major components: route, controller and view.

- Fork and clone this repository to your computer
- Create a new Rails application using `rails new .`
  - create a `Tasks` controller
  - create a route to view the task `index` page
  - create a controller action for the task `index` page which contains an array of hard-coded tasks
  - create an ERB view to display the tasks from the controller action

### Controller Tests

Tests have been created for waves 1 & 2.  You can find the tests in `test/controllers/tasks_controller_test.rb`, and you can execute the tests with `$ rails test`.  You may need to update the test file if your schema differs from the one in the spec.  For waves 3 & 4, we have not provided tests. You will learn how to write controller tests on Monday. It is an optional requirement to to create your own wave 3 and wave 4 tests.

## Wave 1

This wave is where we introduce ActiveRecord to create a model. We use the model to persist our data. Make sure you are building the application so that it meets the requirements of the pre-written tests.

1. create a migration which will create a new `Task` model
    - create the database schema and tables by running the `rails db:migrate` command
    - the `Task` model should include _at least_ a name, a description and a completion date.
    - the three fields should be named:
        - `name` - The name of the task
        - `description` - A text description of the task
        - `completed_at` - The date, saved as text, in which the task was completed.
    - create at least 2 `Task` model instances using the `rails console`
1. update the controller's `index` action you created to retrieve and show `all` Task objects from the database
    - you may need to update the view as well to use the model fields rather than the hard-coded data

## Wave 2

In this wave, we will expand the actions we support and introduce forms for user interactivity and persistence. Again, make sure you are building the application so that it meets the requirements of the pre-written tests.

1. add support to `show` each task
    - update the task list to link to a `show` action for each individual task
    - create a route
    - create a controller action
    - create an ERB view
1. Create a new task:
    - update the task list to have a link to add a new task
      - this will give the user a new page with a **form** with the appropriate task fields
      - the site should take the user to the show page for the task that was just added
1. Verify the success of your controller actions by uncommenting the wave 2 tests and executing them with `$ rails test`.

## Wave 3

In this wave we will extend the interactivity with users, allowing them to edit existing tasks.

1. Edit a task
    - update each task's show page to include an edit link
      - this will give the user a new page with a **form** that is pre-populated with the data about that task
      - the site should take the user back to the task's show page after the task is updated

1. **Optionals**
  - Complete tests by uncommenting and filling in the contents of the Wave 3 tests for the `edit` and `update` actions.  
  - DRY up your code by reusing the view code from the `new` functionality
    - Hint: Rendering _partials_ in Rails

## Wave 4

In this wave, we will add the ability to delete tasks. We will also add the ability for a user to mark a task complete. Note: Marking a task complete will require going above and beyond the examples provided in lecture.  

1. Delete a task  
    On the task list, add a button or link for each task that will, once clicked:
    1. Ask the user to confirm that they definitely want to delete the task.
    1. Delete the task from the database and redirect the user back to the list of remaining tasks
1. Mark a task complete
    - Add a button to the list of tasks on the home page that, when clicked, will mark a task complete
    - Update the database with the task's completed_at date
1. **Optional**
    Write controller tests for the delete and mark complete actions.

## Optional Wave 5: Design

The focus of this project is to familiarize yourself with rails. Design of this application is optional and secondary to learning goals this project. If you do find you have time to style the design of your application, you can use or own design or the wireframes below.
